{"name":"Manylinux-wheel-builder","tagline":"This action builds manylinux wheels for several recent versions of Python (3.6 - 3.9) and publishes to pypi. It uses docker environment provided by pypa's manylinux project. We are using manylinux2010_x86_64 docker container which requires pip >= 19.0 on the client installing the built wheel.","body":"# Manylinux-wheel-builder\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\nIf only want to build and publish wheels for linux platform then below CD action will be enough. It will only build and publish package if pushed commit contains a version tag because this seems the most appropriate in this case but you can change it if you want.\r\n```yml\r\nname: pypi deployer\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    tags:\r\n      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10\r\njobs:\r\n  Linux-build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    env:\r\n      TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TWINE_USERNAME }}\r\n      TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TWINE_PASSWORD }}\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n      - name: build and upload manylinux wheels\r\n        uses:  Niraj-Kamdar/manylinux-wheel-builder@master\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Usage\r\nIf you also want to build and publish wheels for windows and macos in adition to linux, you can append above action with following yaml snippet. This relies on [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.\r\n```yml\r\nMatrix-build:\r\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\r\n    env:\r\n      TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TWINE_USERNAME }}\r\n      TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TWINE_PASSWORD }}\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        os: [macos-latest, windows-latest]\r\n        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8]\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n      - name: Set up Python\r\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v2\r\n        with:\r\n          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\r\n      - name: build wheel\r\n        run: |\r\n          pip install wheel\r\n          python setup.py bdist_wheel\r\n      - name: upload wheel\r\n        run: |\r\n          pip install twine\r\n          twine upload dist/*\r\n        continue-on-error: true\r\n```\r\nCheckout complete CD action I am using for [my project](https://github.com/Niraj-Kamdar/qpt_generator/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml).\r\n## FAQ\r\n**1. Why don't I build wheel on ubuntu-latest and publish it directly to the PyPI?**\r\n\r\nBuilding manylinux-compatible wheels is not trivial; as a general rule, binaries built on one Linux distro will only work on other Linux distros that are the same age or newer. Therefore, if we want to make binaries that run on most Linux distros, we have to use a very old distro -- CentOS 6.\r\n\r\n**2. Why did I choose manylinux2010?**\r\n\r\nPypa's manylinux has mentioned that - \"The manylinux2010 tags allow projects to distribute wheels that are automatically installed (and work!) on the vast majority of desktop and server Linux distributions.\"\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nIf you find any bugs or have any idea to improve this action please file an issue. You are also welcome to improve project documentation.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
